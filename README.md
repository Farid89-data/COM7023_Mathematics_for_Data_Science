## Project Overview

This portfolio applies mathematical principles to two distinct datasets, demonstrating versatility in data science applications. Each mathematical concept is implemented twice: once using the course marking matrix dataset and once using real-world demographic data on multiple births.

### Datasets Used

**Dataset 1: Course Marking Matrix**

The marking matrix provides assessment criteria for the COM7023 module across different grade boundaries. This structured dataset allows demonstration of text processing, categorical analysis, and matrix operations.

**Dataset 2: Human Multiple Births Database**

This dataset contains demographic information about multiple births (twins, triplets) across multiple countries and years. The French subset is used for probability distribution analysis and statistical modelling.

## Mathematical Topics Covered

The portfolio addresses the following mathematical concepts as outlined in the module specification:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Understanding data structures and initial analysis
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Measures of central tendency and dispersion
3. **Normalisation and Standardisation**: Data transformation techniques
4. **Probability Distributions**: Discrete and continuous probability models
5. **Linear Algebra**: Matrix operations and vector spaces
6. **Calculus and Optimisation**: Derivatives, integrals, and optimisation problems
7. **Correlation and Regression**: Statistical relationships and predictive modelling
8. **Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical inference and decision making
